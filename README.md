# Arcade

We are open-sourcing our active codebases and consolidating into one monorepo.

## What

**Now:** Arcade City, the Bitcoin gig economy. Our [v6 mobile app](https://arcade.city/v6) is in [open beta](https://twitter.com/ArcadeCityHall/status/1549569278537437186).

**Later:** The Arcade, Bitcoin's [layer six](https://twitter.com/ArcadeCityHall/status/1533851554515767297).

## Why

Transportation, deliveries, housing, food, finance, energy, infrastructure, governance: all can and should be provided peer-to-peer with no government involvement.

All people deserve to exit broken systems. We are building a destination they can exit to. [[Blog post](https://arcade.city/bitcoin-only)]

## Prior work

This supersedes the [v5 arcade monorepo](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/arcade-v5).
